1. I drew the data we had and where it was stored
2. I started setting up redux and make and reducer and moved the state into the reducer.
3. got all the data connected to my app and passed to the components that needed it.
4. I wrote my click handlers
5. wrote in the actions and added them to the reducer, and then wrote the cases for each action.

the biggest issues I ran into was just figuring out the syntax for the onClick handlers, 
then I was using the wrong name when calling a prop in my components. 
and I also missed line of code in my reducer that took me a little while to figure out.
